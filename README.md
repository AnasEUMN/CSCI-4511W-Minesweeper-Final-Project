# CSCI-4511W-Minesweeper-Final-Project

To run a Minesweeper simulation with one of the heuristics, edit the parameters inside of 
the test_minesweeper_heuristic function to match the desired heuristic (matching numbers can be found in minesweeper.py)
and board logistics. Once those are set, run experiments.py and the state of the board will be printed as the 
game is played along with the final results when the simulation is complete.
